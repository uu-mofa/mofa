Subjects are a way to combine different resources together. For example, if a course contain multiple quizzes about the same topic, you can group those in a subject.

Creating a subject
======================

1. Log in to Mofa.
2. Navigate to ``Subjects``.
3. Click ``ADD SUBJECT`` button in the top right.
4. Give your subject a name.
5. Select a course you want to use this subject at.
6. Select all the resources you want to add to the subject and click the arrow button.
7. Click the ``SAVE`` button.


Using a subject
======================

When selecting resources for Moodle activities you can either select a single resource or a single subject.
For example, using the quiz feedback assistant. Instead of getting a single resource as feedback, your student will receive a list of resources.
