Courses
##############

Mofa automatically imports the courses from Moodle. In the course list you can see all the courses you are a teacher of.

Platform
================

Platform tells you where the course was imported from.

Course ID
================

Course ID is the ID of the course in the Learning Management System (e.g. Moodle) it was imported from.

Inactivity
=================

Here you can enable / disable the inactivity check. The inactivity check will send a message to all of the students who have not viewed your course for a configurable amount of days.

Deadline
================

Here you can enable / disable the deadline check. This sends a message to students a configurable amount of time before a deadline, when they haven't submitted anything. It also sends a message when deadlines have passed and the student has not worked on them.

Resources
==========================

Resources are sources you can use for giving feedback. You can link resources to activities you want feedback on.

Imported resources
----------------------

Imported resources are the resources that have been imported from the Learning Management System (e.g. Moodle).
You can only edit these by changing them inside the LMS. They will automatically update.


External resources
----------------------

External resources are resources you can add inside the Mofa system.
These are not linked to a Learning Management System (e.g. Moodle). You can add these yourself in the Mofa interface.
Make sure you input a valid link, otherwise Mofa will not accept it.

Subjects
=============

Subjects are used for combining resources. For example, if you have multiple Quizzes with the same resources, you don't have to select each of the resources each time.
You can create a subject with the multiple resources and add the subject to one of your activities.
